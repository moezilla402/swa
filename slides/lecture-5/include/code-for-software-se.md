# .red[Coding] for Software Security Engineering

???
Previously learned security engineering activities in the class establish what security means for a solution that satisfies stakeholder security requirements. This prior analysis will now help us identify code where we need to devote efforts such as rigorous code reviews, and automated tests to assure that it is correct.

# Good Code
.right-column[
![xkcd-good-code](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/good_code.png)
]

???
Ultimately, we all want good code! To tell whether code is good or not, we need ways to measure the ability of code to resist attacks, tolerate attacks that it cannot resist, and contain damage and recover to a normal level of operation as soon as possible for attacks that is cannot tolerate.

Attacks are made possible by weaknesses in code. A way to identify and measure weaknesses in code can help minimize the possibility of attacks being successful.

# What to .red[avoid]?
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

???
Good code in particular minimizes the occurrence of weaknesses in code that leads to security issues. To make this assessment, we first need an enumeration of known weaknesses in software that lead to security issues.

An enumeration is typically defined as a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. In this spirit, the common weakness enumeration knowledge base has been developed to help developers and security tools to describe and report weaknesses.

Similarly, testing for security requires launching attacks. Much like crash testing for safety testing. To assist in security testing efforts, the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification or CAPEC has been developed.

There is also much to learn from the countless vulnerabilities that are reported everyday. To facilitate efforts related to reporting and patching vulnerabilities, the common vulnerabilities and exposures database exists.

# What to .green[do]?
- Secure Coding Guidelines

???

Good code can also be defined in terms of defensive coding guidelines. Identifying and measuring such coding practices is facilitated by secure coding guideline knowledge bases.

We will look at all these knowledge bases in enough details that you can readily use them.

# Building Abstractions

## .orange[Weaknesses]\* span a range of languages, products and environments
- Enumeration is appropriate

## .red[Vulnerabilities]\* in code are language, product or environment specific
- Dictionary is appropriate

.footnote[
\* Relationships between a [vulnerability](https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/glossary/#Vulnerability) and [weakness](https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/glossary/#Weakness)
]

???
Some knowledge bases are called enumerations while some are dictionaries. Computer scientists don't use these terms loosely.

Software weaknesses are abstract and hence finite. A single weakness definition can span a range of languages, products and environments. For a relatively finite list of weaknesses, an enumeration is appropriate. Hence the name Common Weakness Enumeration.

Vulnerabilities on the other hand are language, product and environment specific. There is no end to the number of vulnerabilities in software, but each instance is unique. So a dictionary is appropriate to organize vulnerabilities. The common vulnerabilities and exposures knowledge is a dictionary.

In one of the earliest modules, we also discussed the relationship between a vulnerability and a weakness. Vulnerabilities are a set of weaknesses that can be discovered by an attacker and exploited. Weaknesses are mistakes that make vulnerabilities possible. These mistakes can happen in any phase of the software development lifecycle.

## Building Abstractions for .orange[Weaknesses]
Examine commonalities and differences in mistakes
???
Building a weakness enumeration requires examining the commonalities and differences in mistakes. This exercise results in a taxonomy, that can classify mistakes based on their characteristics.

### Leads to useful analysis
- Which class of mistakes to address first?
- What are the related mistakes in an attack vector?
- What are the known/reusable mitigations?

# Learning from .red[mistakes]

## Landwehr Software Flaw Taxonomy (1993)
- Genesis, Location, Time of introduction

???
One of the earliest successful efforts to build an enumeration, was the Landwher flaw taxonomy. It classified flaws along dimensions of genesis, location and time of introduction. This is one of the foundational papers in the field of cybersecurity.

--

## Other [efforts since](https://cwe.mitre.org/about/sources.html)...
- Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, PLOVER, 19 (Now 24) Deadly Sins, OWASP top ten etc,.

???
Several other notable efforts followed since. But no shared standard emerged that was build using community consensus mechanisms. Lack of a shared understanding of software weaknesses hampered progress in communicating, identifying and reporting them.

--

## Common Weaknesses Enumeration [(CWE)](http://cwe.mitre.org)
- Assimilates and advances categorization efforts

???
The department of homeland security recognized this issue and tasked MITRE to develop and maintain the common weakness enumeration that is built using community-input and consensus-based mechanisms.

---

![CWE](http://cwe.mitre.org/about/images/lg_consensus.jpg)

???
So as is to be expected from a consensus-derived solution, the CWE assimilates a lot of prior work in classifying and categorizing software weaknesses. In turn, it is now adopted and used by number of other efforts as shown in this diagram.

Starting in 2020, the CWE also include hardware weaknesses. The growing areas of IoT applications in industrial control systems, wearables, healthcare equipments, and automobiles makes this an important area to focus on.

# CWE purpose
## Measurement
- Unified, .red[measurable] set of weaknesses

## Communication
- Effective .red[sharing], description, selection, and use of security tools and services

## Prioritization
- .red[Ranking] of weaknesses (e.g. [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25))

???
By providing a unique, short identifier to a weakness description, the purpose of the CWE is to make weaknesses measureable. This also aids in effective sharing of knowledge and consistent reporting of issues by different security tools. Measurability is desirable, so that weaknesses can be prioritized based on criteria such as frequency of occurrence and observed severity of their impact. For example, data from publicly reported vulnerabilities is now used to identify the mistakes that lead to them. This produces the CWE top 25 list (Visit website and observe).

class: middle
# CWE Descriptions
- Describe software .blue[behaviors] that operate on .green[resources] in ways that violate desired .orange[properties] that, under the right circumstances, can be exploited by .red[attackers] to cross a security boundary

???
CWE weaknesses are specified at different levels of abstraction. In general, they describe issues related to software behaviors, i.e. things a software does or doesn't do.

Through the behaviors, the software interacts with certain resources. This interaction that may violate certain security-relevant characteristics, i.e. properties, of the behavior or an individual resource.

This violation can be exploited by an attacker to cross a security boundary.

This will make more sense as we examine different weakness abstractions in the CWE.  

---
class: middle
# CWE organization
- .red[Pillar Weakness:] Most abstract, top-level.

> e.g. [CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)

???
The most abstract weakness type is called a Pillar. It is the highest-level weakness that cannot be made any more abstract.

For example, Incorrect Calculation (CWE-682) is an example of a pillar, as it describes a mistake (incorrect calculation) but does not imply anything specific about where such a mistake is made or the type of resource that is affected.

---
class: middle
# CWE organization

- .red[Class Weakness:] Abstract, independent of any specific language or technology.

> e.g. [CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/922.html) describes an issue (Insecure) with a behavior (Store) taken against a general type of resource (Sensitive Information).

???
Class weaknesses are more specific than a Pillar Weakness, but still abstract. They are typically independent of any specific language or technology. Fore example CWE 922 "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information" describes an issue (Insecure) with a behavior (Store) taken against a general type of resource (Sensitive Information).

---
class: middle
# CWE organization
- .red[Base Weakness:] Abstract, sufficient details to infer specific methods for detection and prevention.

>  e.g. [CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html) describes an issue (Inappropriate action) with a behavior (Use) taken against a specific resource (Format String) with a given property (Externally Controlled).

???
A Base weakness is more specific than a Class Weakness, so while being abstract, it has sufficient details to infer specific methods for detection and prevention. For example the base weakness (CWE-134) "Use of Externally-Controlled Format String" describes an issue (inappropriate action) with a behavior (Use of) taken against a specific resource (Format String) with a given property (Externally Controlled)

---
class: middle
# CWE organization

- .red[Variant Weakness:] Detailed, linked to a certain type of product, typically involving a specific language or technology.

> e.g. [CWE-467: Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/467.html) describes an issue (Use of) with a behavior (application of a function) against a resource (Pointer) within an implied language (those that support Pointer Types).

???
A Variant weakness is the most specific type of weakness description. It is linked to a certain type of product, typically involving a specific language or technology. For example CWE-467 "Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type" describes an issue (Use of) with a behavior (application of a sizeof() function) against a resource (Pointer) within an implied language (those that support Pointer Types).

---
class: middle
# CWE organization
- .blue[Views:] A subset of CWE entries that provides a way of examining CWE content.   
e.g. [CWE-1000: Research Concepts](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html)

???
Views help to organize CWEs into convenient subsets. CWE-1000, the research concepts view is a rich hierarchy of weaknesses. Another useful view from a development lifecycle perspective is CWE-699, Software Development View, but the hierarchy is not as deep as CWE-1000.

--


- .orange[Category:] A set of CWEs with a common characteristic. A category is not a weakness!   
e.g. [CWE-320 Key Management Errors](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/320.html)

???
Another organizing unit in the CWE is a Category. It groups a set of CWEs with a common characteristic. Note that a category is not a weakness! You should not be mapping a CWE category to a mistake in software or hardware.  

---
# CWE Organization Example
### Pillar: [CWE-707: Improper Neutralization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/707.html)

### Class: [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

### Base: [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

### Variant: [CWE-85: Doubled Character XSS](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/85.html)

### View: [CWE-1000: Research Concepts](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/85.html)

### Category:[CWE-990: Tainted Input to Command](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/990.html)

???
Here is a collection of CWEs related to Cross-site scripting, which is a common mistake found in web applications. This weakness is clearly described in CWE-79. With cross-site scripting, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website's page structure, which is then delivered to other unsuspecting users. This CWE is a Base Weakness.

We see that there are Class and Pillar weaknessess that are more abstract ways to describe this issue. CWE-20 Improper Input validation is a class weakness and CWE-707–Improper Neutralization is a Pillar weakness. We can also examine a more specific version of cross-site scripting with is CWE 85, Doubled Character XSS. Here the attacker inject two sets of malicious characters. Input validation if done incorrectly, may filter the first character but leave the second one in.

Finally, we see that all these weaknesses are part of the CWE 1000 Research Concepts view. Many of these weaknesses are also share a common characteristic of Tainted input to Command. So you will also find them as members of CWE 990 category.

# Finding the best CWE

## [Mapping Guidance](https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/cwe_usage/mapping_navigation.html)
- Map to a Weakness only
- .red[DO NOT] map to Categories or Views
- Map at the lowest abstraction level possible

## Search resources
- [Full text search](https://cwe.mitre.org/find/index.html)
- Navigating views: [CWE-1000](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html), [CWE-699](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html), [CWE-888](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/888.html)  
Expand all, Turn on .blue[_Show Details_] option
- For a CWE page, turn on .blue[_Mapping-Friendly_] option.  
Then navigate to parent, child, peer relationships

???
From a large CWE collection, it is important that we find the right CWE to describe a mistake in software. Let's look at the mapping guidance from the CWE. First, map to a weakness only. This includes Pillar, Class, Base and Variant Weakness types. Do not map to Categories or View, even though they have a CWE-ID. This is important. Finally, when mapping, pick the lowest level of abstraction among pillar, class, base and variant weaknesses. So, a cross-site scripting weakness that allows doubled character manipulations, would be best mapped to CWE-85 as it is the most specific among CWE listed on the previous slide. Also, it is not a view or a category.

The CWE website, provides several convenient features to find the right CWE. In addition to searching by CWE-ID, it also supports full text search. Another option is to navigate to the views and expand the entire hierarchy. In addition, you can also turn on the show details option to show the CWE description. Now a simple webpage search can be used to look for relevant keywords.

Once you find a relevant CWE, you can also examine its taxonomic and non-taxonomic relationships to find the best fit for your search.

# Exercise
## Which CWE best describes the mistake that led to vulnerability [CVE-2019-10097](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10097)?

- Vulnerability Description:  
In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.32-2.4.39, when mod_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.  

???
Let's try out some of these features. Consider this Vulnerability description in Apache HTTP Webserver. Which CWE do you think best describes the mistake that led to this vulnerability?

Pause here. Use some of the links on the previous slide to conduct your own independent investigation. Make a list of one of more CWEs that you find best captures the mistake that led to this vulnerability. Remember, a good mapping finds the most specific CWE.

--


- The [NVD Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10097) maps this Vulnerability to   
[CWE 476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html) and [CWE 787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

???

Now that you performed your own search, let's compare your results to what the National Vulnerability Database database lists as relevant CWEs.

Your CWEs could be more abstract or more specific than these. But as long as they are in the neighborhood, your search succeeded.  

You can practice your search skills on any recent vulnerability descriptions in the NVD database.

# Some CWEs to Remember
- [CWE-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html): Classic buffer overflow
- [CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html): Use of hardcoded credentials

- [CWE-759](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/759.html): Use of one-way hash without a salt

# CWE Filters
-  Filters for Views, Technical Impacts: [CWE-1000](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html)



???
Having a short identifier makes CWEs very convenient to refer among developers, in training materials and in tool reports. Here are a few CWEs ID to get familiar with. You can see a range of weakness from buffer overflow to file uploads to path traversal.

The CWE webpage also offers easy tools to filter CWE listings based on the mode of introduction, technology platforms and the consequences of the weakness such as read and modify memory or files or many consequences related to availability and reliability of the software or hardware.

For example you can view CWEs related to requirements and design, separate from implementation issues in the research concepts view.

The technical impacts help focus on the set of weaknesses that contribute to the negative technical impact of relevance in a given context. This helps to filter and prioritize a set of weaknesses.

Additional Reading [Optional]: [Technical Impacts](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/cwss_v1.0.1.html#2.3.1) of [Weaknesses](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwraf/ti_scorecard.html)

# CWE Prioritization
## Top CWE lists

- [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html)

## CWE Compatibility
- [CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program](http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/index.html)

???
Based on stakeholder ratings for technical impacts, the CWEs can be prioritized using the Common Weakness Risk Analysis Framework, which uses the Common Weakness Scoring System.

In addition, using data from the National Vulnerability Database, the CWE also publishes a list of top 25 CWEs that results in the most frequent and severe vulnerabilities.

Finally, the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program allows security tools to be reviewed and registered as officially "CWE-Compatible" and "CWE-Effective," The goal is to help organizations select and evaluate tools and/or services to discover weaknesses in their software.

This is also a good place to look for various mature products that provide security services free or for a fee.

# Attack Patterns

???
While CWEs are useful for developer training and development tools, they are not as useful for testing and pentesting efforts. To support testing efforts, the attack patterns are more useful.

---

class: middle
# Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification

## Enumerates .red[attack patterns] used in exploits
- Over 500 attack patterns
- Abstractions:   
Meta, Standard, Detailed Patterns and Categories

## CAPEC:  
- Patterns:  
[CAPEC-242](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/242.html), [CAPEC-63](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/63.html), [CAPEC-86](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/86.html), [CAPEC-245](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/245.html)    
- Views:    
[CAPEC 1000](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html), [CAPEC-3000](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/3000.html)

???
The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC™) is a catalog of attack patterns that helps users understand how adversaries exploit weaknesses in software and hardware.

The organization of CAPEC is similar to CWEs using abstractions, views and categories, except the names are a bit different. Attack patterns are classified as Meta, which is the most abstract, then standard and the most specific ones are called Detailed patterns.

Depending on the level of abstraction, the amount of details describing the exploit vary. For example CAPEC 242 is a Meta Pattern that talks about Code Injection. A related CAPEC 63 is a standard pattern that describes how to explore, experiment and exploit a cross-site scripting weakness. CAPEC 86 is a detailed attack pattern that describes how to exploit cross-site scripting through HTTP headers. It exploits weakness CWE-80, Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)

So you can now start to understand how the Attack Patterns are linked with the Weaknesses. If you were to visit CWE-80, you can can also see related Attack Patterns.

CAPEC Views 1000 and 3000 are good places to start a search for attack patterns.

# Vulnerabilities

???
While we started the discussion with abstractions for weaknesses and attack patterns, the place where these show up together is vulnerabilities. It is important to keep track of publicly reported vulnerabilities for discovery and patching processes.

---

class: middle
# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

## One name for a vulnerability

![cve](http://cve.mitre.org/about/images/cve_example.gif)

???
The common vulnerabilities and exposures is a large dictionary of publicly reported and confirmed vulnerabilities. A short CVE ID is similar to a hashtag on social media sites. Just as a hashtag allows a quick aggregation of posts related to a topic, the unique CVE ID, allows different vulnerability databases to sync their information about a vulnerability with others.

# [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov)

- Total CVEs: [NVD Dashboard](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard)

???
In addition to private vulnerability databases maintained by organizations and tool vendors, the National Institute of Standards and Technologies or NIST also maintains an authoritative database of CVEs. This is called the National Vulnerability Database.

The NVD offered advanced search features and download formats for vulnerability information. It has has a nice dashboard to see the dynamic status of the number of vulnerabilities being reported and their severity.

Vulnerabilities also use a Common Platform Enumeration Scheme to quickly search vulnerabilities in specific vendor products. For example you can use a CPE URL to uniquely reference a particular software product and its version.

More recently, the NVD database started to consistently link vulnerabilities to related common weaknesses using CWE IDs.

# Visual Recap
![relationships](images/CVE-CWE-CAPEC.png)

???
Here is a summary of the state-of-the-art knowledge bases today that make the "badness of code" measure-able. Weaknesses are attacked by Attack Patterns, which in turn confirm the presence of vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are realizations of Weaknesses that are exploitable.

In your semester projects or any software assurance project that involves reviewing code, it is important to translate your findings into corresponding weakness and attack pattern definitions. This mapping will help you measure the "badness" of your codebase that can be discovered using manual or automated code review. The amount of "badness" that can be discovered is directly proportional to the quality of the manual or automated tools for code review.

# Secure Coding Guidelines

class: middle
# CERT Secure Coding Guidelines
- Normative requirements (aka. coding standards) for programming languages
- [C, C++, Java, Perl, and the Android platform](https://www.securecoding.cert.org)
- Software development and software security communities
- Violation does not mean vulnerability but a weakness


## Rules
- [DCL30-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/DCL30-C.+Declare+objects+with+appropriate+storage+durations), [MEM30-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/MEM30-C.+Do+not+access+freed+memory)

???
The SEI CERT Secure Coding Guidelines are developed through a broad-based community effort for commonly used programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Perl, and the Android™ platform.

Similar to the CWE, the secure coding guidelines also have a short identifier. For example DCL30-C, indicates that is a guideline about declaration and initialization (DCL) for the C language. More specifically, it recommends that objects must be declared with appropriate storage durations. Its specification provides examples of both non-compliant and compliant code.

In addition both the CWE and the secure coding guidelines cross reference each other. This mapping makes a great teaching tool for secure coding.

### CWE-119: Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
- The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
- Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data. As a result, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause the system to crash.
